The goal of `rmotis` is to automate installation of the [MOTIS](https://github.com/motis-project/motis) server for routing and provide user friendly API for the most common use cases in a manner simialar to [`{r5r}`](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/) and [`osrm`](https://github.com/riatelab/osrm) + [`osrm.backend`](https://github.com/e-kotov/osrm.backend).

This is highly experimental, use at your own risk. `rmotis` depends on [`motis.client`](https://github.com/e-kotov/motis.client) R package which is entirely generated form official API spec using [`openapi3`](https://github.com/e-kotov/openapi3/) R package. All pieces of this are experimental and may break at any time.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rmotis from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("e-kotov/rmotis")
```
