\title{Builds a MOTIS one-to-many request manually and saves it to a text file.}
\usage{
motis_one_to_many_txt_1(
  one,
  many,
  output_file,
  mode = c("WALK", "BIKE", "CAR"),
  arrive_by = FALSE,
  max = 7200,
  maxMatchingDistance = 1000,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{one}{The single origin (when \code{arrive_by = FALSE}) or destination
(when \code{arrive_by = TRUE}). Can be a character string of an ID,
a data frame/tibble with one row and coordinate columns, an \code{sf} object with a
single POINT geometry, or a numeric vector/matrix (\code{lon}, \code{lat}).}

\item{many}{The multiple destinations (when \code{arrive_by = FALSE}) or origins
(when \code{arrive_by = TRUE}). Can be a character vector of IDs, a data
frame/tibble with ID or coordinate columns, an \code{sf} object with POINT
geometry, or a numeric matrix (\code{lon}, \code{lat}).}

\item{output_file}{The path to the output text file where the request URL
will be written.}

\item{mode}{The routing profile to use. Defaults to \code{"WALK"}.}

\item{arrive_by}{Logical. If \code{FALSE} (the default), calculates routes from
\code{one} to \code{many}. If \code{TRUE}, calculates routes from \code{many} to \code{one}.}

\item{max}{maximum travel time in seconds}

\item{maxMatchingDistance}{maximum matching distance in meters to match geo coordinates to the street network}

\item{...}{Additional parameters to be passed to the MOTIS One-to-Many API.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a character vector containing the generated request
string. The primary side effect is writing this string to \code{output_file}.
}
\description{
This function efficiently constructs the API request for a one-to-many or
many-to-one query by building the URL string manually. It writes the
resulting URL (path and query string) to a specified text file. This is
useful for scenarios where requests are generated in one step and executed
later, for example with a bulk processing tool.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# --- Example Usage ---

# Define a single origin point and multiple destination points
origin_point <- data.frame(lat = 52.525, lon = 13.369) # Berlin Hbf

destination_points <- data.frame(
  name = c("Brandenburg Gate", "Reichstag Building"),
  lat = c(52.516, 52.518),
  lon = c(13.377, 13.376)
)

# --- Generate a request to find walking times from the origin to destinations ---
motis_one_to_many_txt_1(
  one = origin_point,
  many = destination_points,
  output_file = "onemany_request.txt",
  mode = "WALK",
  max = 3600 # Max travel time of 1 hour in seconds
)

# The file "onemany_request.txt" will contain a single line like:
# api/v1/one-to-many?one=52.525;13.369&many=52.516;13.377,52.518;13.376&...
