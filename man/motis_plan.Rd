\usage{
motis_plan(
  from,
  to,
  time = Sys.time(),
  arrive_by = FALSE,
  from_id_col = "id",
  to_id_col = "id",

}
\arguments{
\item{from}{The origin location(s). Can be a character vector of station IDs,
a data frame/tibble with ID or coordinate columns, an \code{sf}
object with POINT geometry, or a numeric matrix (\code{lon}, \code{lat}).}

\item{to}{The destination location(s). Must be of the same type as \code{from}.
For paired journey planning, must be the same length as \code{from}. For
travel time matrix calculation, length can be different.}

\item{time}{The departure or arrival time. Can be a POSIXct object (like from
\code{Sys.time()}) or a character string in ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2025-08-15T15:11:00Z").
Defaults to the current time.}

\item{arrive_by}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, \code{time} is treated as the arrival time.
Defaults to \code{FALSE} (departure time).}

\item{from_id_col}{The name of the column in \code{from} containing station IDs.
Defaults to \code{"id"}.}

\item{to_id_col}{The name of the column in \code{to} containing station IDs.
Defaults to \code{"id"}.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[motis.client:mc_plan]{motis.client::mc_plan}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{via}}{List of via stops to visit (only stop IDs, no coordinates allowed for now).
Also see the optional parameter \code{viaMinimumStay} to set a set a minimum stay duration for each via stop.}
    \item{\code{viaMinimumStay}}{Optional. If not set, the default is \verb{0,0} - no stay required.

For each \code{via} stop a minimum stay duration in minutes.

The value \code{0} signals that it's allowed to stay in the same trip.
This enables via stays without counting a transfer and can lead
to better connections with less transfers. Transfer connections can
still be found with \code{viaMinimumStay=0}.}
    \item{\code{maxTransfers}}{The maximum number of allowed transfers (i.e. interchanges between transit legs,
pre- and postTransit do not count as transfers).
\code{maxTransfers=0} searches for direct transit connections without any transfers.
If you want to search only for non-transit connections (\code{FOOT}, \code{CAR}, etc.),
send an empty \code{transitModes} parameter instead.

If not provided, the routing uses the server-side default value
which is hardcoded and very high to cover all use cases.

\emph{Warning}: Use with care. Setting this too low can lead to
optimal (e.g. the fastest) journeys not being found.
If this value is too low to reach the destination at all,
it can lead to slow routing performance.

In plan endpoints before v3, the behavior is off by one,
i.e. \code{maxTransfers=0} only returns non-transit connections.}
    \item{\code{maxTravelTime}}{The maximum travel time in minutes.
If not provided, the routing to uses the value
hardcoded in the server which is usually quite high.

\emph{Warning}: Use with care. Setting this too low can lead to
optimal (e.g. the least transfers) journeys not being found.
If this value is too low to reach the destination at all,
it can lead to slow routing performance.}
    \item{\code{minTransferTime}}{Optional. Default is 0 minutes.

Minimum transfer time for each transfer in minutes.}
    \item{\code{additionalTransferTime}}{Optional. Default is 0 minutes.

Additional transfer time reserved for each transfer in minutes.}
    \item{\code{transferTimeFactor}}{Optional. Default is 1.0

Factor to multiply minimum required transfer times with.
Values smaller than 1.0 are not supported.}
    \item{\code{maxMatchingDistance}}{Optional. Default is 25 meters.

Maximum matching distance in meters to match geo coordinates to the street network.}
    \item{\code{pedestrianProfile}}{Optional. Default is \code{FOOT}.

Accessibility profile to use for pedestrian routing in transfers
between transit connections, on the first mile, and last mile.

Allowed values: FOOT, WHEELCHAIR.}
    \item{\code{elevationCosts}}{Optional. Default is \code{NONE}.

Set an elevation cost profile, to penalize routes with incline.
\itemize{
\item \code{NONE}: No additional costs for elevations. This is the default behavior
\item \code{LOW}: Add a low cost for increase in elevation and incline along the way. This will prefer routes with less ascent, if small detours are required.
\item \code{HIGH}: Add a high cost for increase in elevation and incline along the way. This will prefer routes with less ascent, if larger detours are required.
}

As using an elevation costs profile will increase the travel duration,
routing through steep terrain may exceed the maximal allowed duration,
causing a location to appear unreachable.
Increasing the maximum travel time for these segments may resolve this issue.

The profile is used for direct routing, on the first mile, and last mile.

Elevation cost profiles are currently used by following street modes:
\itemize{
\item \code{BIKE}
}

Allowed values: NONE, LOW, HIGH.}
    \item{\code{useRoutedTransfers}}{Optional. Default is \code{false}.

Whether to use transfers routed on OpenStreetMap data.}
    \item{\code{detailedTransfers}}{\itemize{
\item true: Compute transfer polylines and step instructions.
\item false: Only return basic information (start time, end time, duration) for transfers.
}}
    \item{\code{joinInterlinedLegs}}{Optional. Default is \code{true}.

Controls if a journey section with stay-seated transfers is returned:
\itemize{
\item \code{joinInterlinedLegs=false}: as several legs (full information about all trip numbers, headsigns, etc.).
Legs that do not require a transfer (stay-seated transfer) are marked with \code{interlineWithPreviousLeg=true}.
\item \code{joinInterlinedLegs=true} (default behavior): as only one joined leg containing all stops
}}
    \item{\code{transitModes}}{Optional. Default is \code{TRANSIT} which allows all transit modes (no restriction).
Allowed modes for the transit part. If empty, no transit connections will be computed.
For example, this can be used to allow only \verb{METRO,SUBWAY,TRAM}.

Allowed values: WALK, BIKE, RENTAL, CAR, CAR_PARKING, CAR_DROPOFF, ODM, FLEX, TRANSIT, TRAM, SUBWAY, FERRY, AIRPLANE, METRO, BUS, COACH, RAIL, HIGHSPEED_RAIL, LONG_DISTANCE, NIGHT_RAIL, REGIONAL_FAST_RAIL, REGIONAL_RAIL, CABLE_CAR, FUNICULAR, AREAL_LIFT, OTHER.}
    \item{\code{directModes}}{Optional. Default is \code{WALK} which will compute walking routes as direct connections.

Modes used for direction connections from start to destination without using transit.
Results will be returned on the \code{direct} key.

Note: Direct connections will only be returned on the first call. For paging calls, they can be omitted.

Note: Transit connections that are slower than the fastest direct connection will not show up.
This is being used as a cut-off during transit routing to speed up the search.
To prevent this, it's possible to send two separate requests (one with only \code{transitModes} and one with only \code{directModes}).

Note: the output \code{direct} array will stay empty if the input param \code{maxDirectTime} makes any direct trip impossible.

Only non-transit modes such as \code{WALK}, \code{BIKE}, \code{CAR}, \code{BIKE_SHARING}, etc. can be used.

Allowed values: WALK, BIKE, RENTAL, CAR, CAR_PARKING, CAR_DROPOFF, ODM, FLEX, TRANSIT, TRAM, SUBWAY, FERRY, AIRPLANE, METRO, BUS, COACH, RAIL, HIGHSPEED_RAIL, LONG_DISTANCE, NIGHT_RAIL, REGIONAL_FAST_RAIL, REGIONAL_RAIL, CABLE_CAR, FUNICULAR, AREAL_LIFT, OTHER.}
